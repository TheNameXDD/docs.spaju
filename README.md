# Main page

Hello there! \

You can here in my documentation find some useful information and other stuff (projects, files, sources, and more). This website is about: robotics and automation. I researched whole Internet information that I could find and posted here, in my opinion, the coolest information that will be useful for students and enthusiasts.
